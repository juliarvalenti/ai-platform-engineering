"""Backend callback client.

The agent's persist hook and ingest log appender call back to
`ttt-backend/internal/...` instead of writing sqlite directly. This
module is the single httpx-based wrapper they go through.

All callbacks include the per-agent bearer token (`TTT_AGENT_TOKEN` env)
on the `Authorization` header. The backend's auth dependency validates
it against the orchestrator's in-memory map.

Synchronous fallbacks exist because the SDK's PostToolUse hooks run in
sync context inside the SDK loop — async-only would deadlock. We use
short timeouts and best-effort fire-and-forget for log appends; page
writes block so the agent doesn't run ahead of the backend's revision
log.
